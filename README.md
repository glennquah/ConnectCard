Link to APK: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sdKgctwhZuty5yzFxVUUMiuW6nRoqbCH?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sdKgctwhZuty5yzFxVUUMiuW6nRoqbCH?usp=drive_link) 


# Motivation


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Problem:</span>

Carrying physical name cards and membership/loyalty cards can be **burdensome**, leading to **lost contact information and a cluttered wallet**. It is **inconvenient** for individuals who meet new people, engage in business interactions, or collect various membership cards to **manage and access these cards efficiently.**


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Solution:</span>

ConnectCard provides a convenient solution by allowing users to scan physical name cards using their phone camera and convert them into digital cards stored within the application. Users can easily update their personal digital name cards, keeping their contact information up to date for seamless interactions. The application also enables users to add other users as friends easily by scanning a QR Code and sending the QR code through social media such as telegram and whatsapp. With our app, individuals can simplify their wallet, stay connected with ease, and take full advantage of membership benefits without the hassle of physical cards.


# Aim

The primary objective of our Orbital project is to develop a sophisticated mobile application that facilitates effortless storage and management of personal name cards, along with seamless user connectivity. Our ultimate vision is to eliminate the reliance on physical name cards and alleviate the inconvenience of carrying a bulky wallet through the streamlined functionality of this app. Designed for recruiters, professionals, job seekers, and everyone else. Simplify networking, all in one place.


# How are we different from Existing Platforms


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Description</span>

ConnectCard utilizes Firebase for data storage and manipulation, and Flutter for the user interface design. It offers various features such as scanning and storing name card information, linking the app to communication platforms like Telegram, Whatsapp, Phone, and Email, updating existing data, and QR Code technology for easy name card exchange.


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Need:</span>

Currently, there are existing name card applications that provide features such as storing and managing digital name cards of self and others. However, there are some few applications that satisfy some features that are important in a digital name card application.

Existing name card applications have limited functionality in these areas:
- Converting current physical name cards into digital name cards easily
- Sharing digital name cards with others easily


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Key Technologies</span>


### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

ConnectCard utilizes OCR technology to extract text and relevant information from scanned name cards. This technology enables automatic data entry and ensures accurate digitization of the name card details.


### Image Processing

Image processing techniques are employed to enhance the scanned name card images, improve readability, and optimize the visual quality of the digitized cards. This helps in creating clear and professional-looking digital name cards.


### Mobile Camera Integration

ConnectCard seamlessly integrates with the mobile device's camera functionality, allowing users to capture images of physical name cards directly within the app. This integration simplifies the scanning process, making it convenient for users to convert physical cards into digital format effortlessly.


### Cloud Storage and Synchronization (Firebase)

To ensure data accessibility across multiple devices, our application integrates with cloud storage services. The digital name cards and associated data are securely stored in the cloud, enabling users to access and manage their cards from any device with the application installed. Synchronization functionality ensures that any updates made to the cards are reflected across all devices.


### QR Code Sharing

ConnectCard leverages QR code technology for the seamless exchange of digital name cards between users. Users can instantly add other users as friends by scanning their QR code, or even share their own personal QR code via social media such as telegram and whatsapp, fostering efficient networking and eliminating the need for manual contact input.


### Notes:

We decided to swap out the initially planned out NFC technology for the seamless exchange of digital name cards for QR Code Sharing. This is because QR Code is a widely used technology that users are used to using. Additionally, we are also using the camera for other functions such as the OCR to convert physical name cards into digital name cards, which means users would be more familiar with the scanning action with the camera, allowing easier familiarization of the app.

# System Design

## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application Flow</span>

![1](readme_assets/systemdesign_assets/1.png)


### Authentication

When the ConnectCard app is opened, it checks for persistent login information. If the user is already logged in, they are directed to the Home Page. Otherwise, they are brought to the Login Page to authenticate their credentials.

On the Login Page, users have the option to toggle between the Login and Register pages. After inputting the correct email and password values, the app authenticates these values with Firebase. If the email and password are correct, the user is directed to the Home Page. If the authentication fails, the user is given the opportunity to try again.


### View Profile

By pressing the top app bar button, the user is able to edit their profile, including their name, headline, and profile picture. Users can also click the "Contact Us" button to get in touch with customer service via email or phone or log out of the application.


### Card Editing

Users have the ability to edit their card information, add and delete new cards.


### Home Page

On the Home Page, users can view their existing cards in either a list or card view. The cards display basic information such as name, organization, position, phone number, and email address. By clicking on a card, they will be directed to another screen showing detailed information, with the ability to interact with the phone number, email, and website for communication.


### Connect

By clicking on the "Connect" button, the QR Code generator will be triggered, and a personalized QR Code will appear. Users can choose to scan other users' QR Codes to add them as friends or share them via social media, enabling others to connect with them.


### OCR Image to Text converter

The Scan Cards Page requires permission from the user to access the camera. Once permission is granted, users can take a photo of a name card. The app utilizes Google ML Kit and text recognition technology to convert the image into text, extracting relevant information from the name card. It filters the phone number, email address, website, and address. Users can choose to add the information as a personal card, which will be reflected in their list of cards, or as a friend's card, which will appear in the cards tab for easy reference. This allows users to digitize all their name cards, capturing them as pictures for convenient access in case of discrepancies.


### Card Tab

After scanning other users' physical name cards, the user can view or edit the following cards.


### Adding friend

By clicking on the blue button, users can easily search for friends as it displays the full list of users using ConnectCard. Additionally, they can search for friends through their UID, name, and headline. After finding their profile, users can send a friend request. Upon receiving a friend request, the friend request tab turns red, indicating the number of requests. Users are able to accept or decline the friend requests.


### Viewing friend cards

After the request is accepted, users can click on their friend's profile and look through their list of cards. The color of the card will be different to indicate that it belongs to the friend, not the user.


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Class Relationship / Database ER Diagram</span>

![2](readme_assets/systemdesign_assets/2.png)

![3](readme_assets/systemdesign_assets/3.png)

Every user document is split into 2 collection. “Friends” and “UserData”. This is to ensure security, easy access to specific data and to reduce impact on existing functionalities when updating user information.


### Enhanced Security

To separate sensitive data, ensuring that users only have access to the information they are authorized to see. This prevent potential security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive ser relationship


### Easier access to specific Data

By having a dedicated “Friends” collection, it allows for efficient querying and retrieval of friend related information. When a user wants to retrieve their list of friends, accept or decline friend requests, or perform any action related to their friends, the system can directly access the "Friends" collection without needing to fetch unnecessary data from the "UserData" collection. This separation simplifies data retrieval and improves the overall performance of friend-related operations.


### Reduced impact on updates

When a user updates their profile information (e.g., name, headline, profile picture), having a separate "UserData" collection ensures that changes to user-specific data won't interfere with friend-related data. This separation minimizes the risk of accidental data corruption or inconsistencies. Additionally, it simplifies the process of updating user data without affecting friend connections or vice versa.


### Simplified User Management

Splitting data into logical collections can improve the management of user-related data. Administrators or developers can focus on specific tasks related to friends and friend requests without having to navigate through unrelated user data. This compartmentalization streamlines maintenance and development processes.


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Software Architecture</span>

![1](readme_assets/systemdesign_assets/4.png)


# Software Engineering Practices

Here are some of the software engineering practices that we used for our Orbital project.

## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Management with GitHub Projects</span>


### Github Milestones

When embarking on a new feature, we establish dedicated milestones that align with the overarching project goals. Each milestone serves as a crucial stepping stone towards the successful completion of the feature, ensuring that our efforts are focused and well-organized.


![1](readme_assets/swe_assets/1.png)


### Issues

As part of our milestone-driven development process, we leverage Git issues to effectively manage and track the progress of our work. Once we have established milestones, we break down feature development into smaller, manageable tasks and create Git issues to encapsulate them. This granular breakdown enables us to focus on specific aspects of the feature, promoting efficiency and collaboration among team members. Moreover, we will delegate the tasks, apply labels for easy categorization, and assign them to our project for efficient project management.

![2](readme_assets/swe_assets/2.png)


### Labels

By using Git labels, after creating each issue, we will apply different labels to categorize it based on its content. This will help us easily understand what each issue is about and organize them accordingly.

![3](readme_assets/swe_assets/3.png)


### Work allocation

By utilizing a Git project spreadsheet, we can have an overview of the work allocation. All the issues are listed down as tasks, and we can track the status of each task. This provides a clear picture of how the work is distributed among team members and helps us monitor progress efficiently. The spreadsheet allows us to keep track of completed tasks, ongoing work, and pending items, ensuring that the project stays on track and all team members are aligned with their assigned tasks.

![4](readme_assets/swe_assets/4.png)


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Version Control</span>

### Branching

By utilizing the branching feature in Git, we ensure a structured and organized development process. Whenever we work on a new feature or bug fix, we create a separate branch for it. This approach allows multiple team members to work on different features concurrently without causing conflicts or discrepancies in the codebase.

Each branch represents a specific task or feature, which helps us maintain code isolation and makes it easier to review and test changes independently. Once the feature is completed or the bug is fixed, we thoroughly test the code to ensure its functionality and reliability.

Only after testing and verification, we proceed with creating a pull request to merge the branch into the main branch. By following this branching workflow, we minimize the risk of introducing bugs and maintain a stable main branch that represents the most up-to-date and tested version of the project. It promotes collaboration, transparency, and effective code management throughout the development process.

![5](readme_assets/swe_assets/5.png)


### Pull request

We follow a structured approach by first testing our branches thoroughly. Instead of directly updating the main branch, we utilize Git pull requests. This enables others to review the code and helps prevent any discrepancies before merging. This collaborative process ensures code quality and maintains a stable main branch.

![6](readme_assets/swe_assets/6.png)

![7](readme_assets/swe_assets/7.png)


### Releases / Tags

By creating releases and tagging them with version numbers via milestones, it becomes easy to track and manage different versions of the software. This helps in keeping a clear record of each release and allows us to revert to specific versions if needed.

![8](readme_assets/swe_assets/8.png)


# Testing

For testing, we have split it into 2, automated testing and user testing.

1. Automated TestingUnit test: To test a single function, method or class
2. Integration test: to test the complete app or a large part of the app
3. User Testing
* Scenario based testing: design test scenarios that replicate real-world situation that users might encounter
* Diverse user representation: including different demographics, skill levels and backgrounds
* Bug reporting and tracking: provide a simple and clear way for users to report bus and issues through a google  form
